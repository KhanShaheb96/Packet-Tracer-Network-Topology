# Network Topology Lab

This repository contains a network topology designed for a Computer Networks course. The setup includes routers, switches, and PCs, possibly simulating a LAN, VLAN, or routing scenario.

## Devices & Interfaces
- **Routers:** `Se0/2/0`, `Fa0/0`, `Fa0/1`, `24T1`
- **Switches:** `Fa0/1`, `Fa0/2`, `24TT`
- **End Devices:** `PC0`, `PC1`, `Server0`

## Purpose
- This lab likely demonstrates:
  - Basic network device connections.
  - Interface configurations (e.g., `Fa0/0`, `Se0/2/0`).
  - Routing or switching concepts.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (or similar network simulator).

## How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Examine the topology and configurations.
3. Test connectivity (if applicable).

## Note
This was part of a university/course assignment in Computer Networks.
